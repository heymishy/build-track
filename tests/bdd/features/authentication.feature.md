# Feature: User Authentication and Authorization

**GitHub Issue:** #123 - Implement comprehensive authentication system  
**Epic:** User Management  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Tags:** authentication, security, user-management

The BuildTrack application provides secure authentication with role-based access control to ensure that users can only access features appropriate to their role and permissions.

## Background

Given the application is running
And the database is seeded with test users
And I am on the login page

<!-- @critical,authentication -->
## Scenario: Admin user successful login

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to log in with my credentials  
**So that** I can access admin features and manage the system

Given I am on the login page
When I enter admin@buildtrack.com in the email field
And I enter "admin123" in the password field
And I click the "Sign In" button
Then I should be on the "dashboard" page
And I should see "Admin Dashboard"
And the "navigation" should contain "User Management"

<!-- @critical,authentication -->
## Scenario: Regular user successful login

**As a** project manager  
**I want** to log in with my credentials  
**So that** I can manage my assigned projects

Given I am on the login page
When I enter user@buildtrack.com in the email field
And I enter "user123" in the password field
And I click the "Sign In" button
Then I should be on the "dashboard" page
And I should see "Project Dashboard"
And the "navigation" should contain "Projects"
But the "navigation" should not contain "User Management"

<!-- @high,authentication -->
## Scenario: Invalid login credentials

**As a** user  
**I want** to see clear error messages for invalid credentials  
**So that** I understand what went wrong

Given I am on the login page
When I enter invalid@email.com in the email field
And I enter "wrongpassword" in the password field
And I click the "Sign In" button
Then I should see "Invalid email or password"
And I should be on the "login" page

<!-- @medium,authentication -->
## Scenario: Role-based access control

**As a** viewer user  
**I want** appropriate restrictions on my access  
**So that** I cannot perform actions beyond my role

Given I am logged in as a "viewer"
And I am on the "dashboard" page
When I visit "/settings"
Then I should see "Access Denied"
And I should be redirected to the "dashboard" page

<!-- @high,authentication -->
## Scenario: Session timeout handling

**As a** user  
**I want** to be logged out after inactivity  
**So that** my account remains secure

Given I am logged in as a "user"
And I am on the "dashboard" page
When I wait 3600 seconds
And I click the "Projects" button
Then I should see "Session expired"
And I should be on the "login" page

<!-- @medium,authentication -->
## Scenario: Remember me functionality

**As a** frequent user  
**I want** to stay logged in across browser sessions  
**So that** I don't need to log in repeatedly

Given I am on the login page
When I enter user@buildtrack.com in the email field
And I enter "user123" in the password field
And I check the "Remember me" checkbox
And I click the "Sign In" button
And I close the browser
And I reopen the browser
And I visit "/"
Then I should be on the "dashboard" page
And I should see "Project Dashboard"
