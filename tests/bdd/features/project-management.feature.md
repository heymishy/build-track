# Feature: Project Management Lifecycle

**GitHub Issue:** #125 - Comprehensive project management workflows  
**Epic:** Core Project Management  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Tags:** project-management, dashboard, collaboration

The BuildTrack application provides comprehensive project management capabilities allowing users to create, manage, and track construction projects from inception to completion with full lifecycle management.

## Background

Given the application is running
And I am logged in as a "user"
And I am on the "dashboard" page

<!-- @critical,project-management,crud -->

## Scenario: View project overview dashboard

**As a** project manager  
**I want** to see an overview of my projects  
**So that** I can track project status and access project details

Given I am on the "dashboard" page
And I should see "Project Overview"
When I have projects in the system
Then I should see project cards in the "All Projects" section
And each project card should contain:

- Project name
- Status badge
- Budget information
- Creation date
  When I click the "View Details →" button on a project card
  Then I should navigate to the project detail view

<!-- @high,project-management,dashboard -->

## Scenario: Navigate between project phases

**As a** project manager  
**I want** to view projects by their current phase  
**So that** I can focus on projects in specific lifecycle stages

Given I have projects in different phases
When I visit the "dashboard" page
Then I should see phase-based navigation options
When I click on "Planning Phase"
Then I should see "Planning Phase" header
And I should see projects in planning stage
When I click on "Construction Phase"
Then I should see "Construction Phase" header  
And I should see active construction projects
When I click on "Completion Phase"
Then I should see "Completion Phase" header
And I should see completed projects

<!-- @medium,project-management,editing -->

## Scenario: Project status visibility

**As a** project manager  
**I want** to see project status information clearly  
**So that** I can understand project health at a glance

Given I have projects in different statuses
And I am on the "dashboard" page
When I view project cards in the "All Projects" section
Then each project card should show a status badge
And the badge should indicate "Planning", "In Progress", "Completed", "On Hold", or "Cancelled"
And I should see budget information formatted as currency
And I should see the creation date for each project

<!-- @low,project-management,navigation -->

## Scenario: Project detail navigation

**As a** project manager  
**I want** to navigate to project details  
**So that** I can manage individual projects

Given I have a project in the system
And I am on the "dashboard" page
When I click the "View Details →" button on a project card
Then I should navigate to the project-specific dashboard view
And the URL should include the project identifier
